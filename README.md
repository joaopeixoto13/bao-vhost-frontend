# bao-vhost-frontend

The bao-vhost-frontend crate furnishes an infrastructure capable of implementing the frontend/master side of the vhost-user protocol. This implementation is designed to be compatible with the Bao hypervisor and allows the verification of the hypervisor-agnostic nature of Rust-based vhost-user backends.
